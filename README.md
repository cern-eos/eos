# EOS

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/cern-eos/eos](https://badges.gitter.im/cern-eos/eos.svg)](https://gitter.im/cern-eos/eos?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

## Description

**EOS** is a software solution that aims to provide fast and reliable multi-PB
disk-only storage technology for both LHC and non-LHC use-cases at CERN. The
core of the implementation is the XRootD framework which provides feature-rich
remote access protocol. The storage system is running on commodity hardware
with disks in JBOD configuration. It is written mostly in C/C++, with some of
the extra modules in Python. Files can be accessed via native **XRootD**
protocol, a **POSIX-like FUSE** client or **HTTP(S) & WebDav** protocol.

## Documentation

The most up to date documentation can be found at:
http://eos.readthedocs.org/en/latest/


**Doxygent** documentaion of the API is available in the ``./doc`` directory
 and can be generated using the following command:

```bash
# Inside the EOS git clone directory
cd doc
doxygen
....
# Documentation generated in the ./html directory which can be accessed using any browser
# file:///eos_git_clone_dir/doc/html/index.html
```

## Build

To build **EOS**, you need **gcc (>=4.4)** and **CMake** installed on your system:
```bash
# Create build workdir
mkdir build
cd build
# Run CMake
cmake ..
# Build
make -j 4
```

## Install/Uninstall

The default behaviour is to install **EOS** at system level using `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr`.
To change the default install prefix path, do the following:

```bash
# Modify the default install path
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/other_path
# Install - might require sudo privileges
make install
# Uninstall
make uninstall
```

## Source/Binary RPM Generation

To build the source/binary RPMs run:

```bash
# Create source tarball
make dist
# Create Source RPM
make srpm
# Create RPMS
make rpm
```

## System specific notes

* The current production version of **EOS** in the **beryl_aquamarine** branch
which has a hard requirement on **XRootD 3.3.6**.
* The the future production version of **EOS** is the **citrine** branch and
 requires **XRootD >= 4.2.0**.

## Bug Reporting

You can send **EOS** bug reports to <project-eos@cern.ch>. The preferable way,
if you have access, is use the online bug tracking system
[Jira ](https://its.cern.ch/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa) to submit new problem
 reports or search for existing ones: https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/EOS

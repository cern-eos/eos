# This file contains a list of commits that should be ignored by some git commands including `git blame`.
# You may need to enable this feature in your git configuration by running:
# - git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
# Web interfaces of git such as GitHub and GitLab also support this feature.
# Commits that do not add or change any functionality but only reformat the code or fix typos should be added to this file. This way, when you run `git blame` on a file, you won't see these commits and can focus on the commits that actually changed the code.
# The following command can be run to check if any of the commits in this file are missing from the history:
# - for rev in $(grep -vE '^#|^$' .git-blame-ignore-revs); do git rev-parse -q --verify "${rev}^{commit}" >/dev/null || echo "Missing: $rev"; done

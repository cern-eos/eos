* [EOS-3251] - Expose Central drain thread pool status in monitoring format
* [EOS-3269] - path display in `eos file check` output
* [EOS-3295] - Allow MGMs to retrieve stacktraces and log files from eosxd at runtime

Note
-----

Starting with this version one can control the xrootd pool of physical connections
by using the following two env variables:
EOS_XRD_USE_CONNECTION_POOL - enable the xrootd connection pool
EOS_XRD_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE - max number of unique phisical connection
towards a particular host.
This can be use in the MGM daemon to control connection pool for TPC transfers
used in the Converter and the Central Draining, but also on the FST side for
FST to FST transfers.

The following two env variables that proided similar functionality only on the
FST side are now obsolete:
EOS_FST_XRDIO_USE_CONNECTION_POOL
EOS_FST_XRDIO_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE

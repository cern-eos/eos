eosxd log file
--------------

eosxd writes a log file into the fusex log direcotory ```/var/log/eos/fusex/fuse.<instancename>-<mountdir>.log```. The default verbosity is **warning** level.

eosxd statistics file
----------------------

eosxd writes out a statistics file with an update rate of 1Hz into the fusex log directory ```/var/log/eos/fusex/fuse.<instancename>-<mountdir>.stats```.


Here is an example:

   ========== ====================== =============== ===========================================================================

The statistics file can be printed by any user on request by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   eosxd get eos.stats <mount-point>
  
The statistics file counter can be reset by running as root:

.. code-block:: bash

   eosxd set system.eos.resetstat - /eos/

Server Side Configuration
-------------------------

The **eosxd** network provides four configuration parameters, which can be shown or modified using **eos fusex conf**

.. code-block:: bash

   [root@eos ]# eos fusex conf
   info: configured FUSEX broadcast max. client audience 256 listeners
   info: configured FUSEX broadcast audience to suppress match is '@b[67]'
   info: configured FUSEX heartbeat interval is 10 seconds
   info: configured FUSEX quota check interval is 10 seconds

The default heartbeat interval is 10 seconds. It is the interval each **eosxd** process sends a heartbeat message to the MGM server. The quota check interval is the interval after which the MGM FuseServer checks again if a **eosxd** client went out of quota or back to quota. The default is also 10 seconds. 

When working with thousands of clients within a single directory the amount of messages in the FuseServer broadcast network can overwhelm the MGM messaging capacity. To reduce the amount of messages sent around while files are open and written, a threshold can be defined after which a certain audience of clients will not receive anymore meta-data update or forced refresh messages. If 1000 clients write 1000 files within a single directory the message rate is 100kHz for file-size updates while the clients are writing. In the example above if a message hits more than 256 listeners and the client names start with b6 or b6 messages will be suppressed. Messages emitted when files are created or commmitted are not suppressed!


Namespace Configuration
-----------------------

By default each client sends his desired leastime for directory subscriptions (300s default at time of writing). For certain directories in the hierarchy which are essentially read-only it improves the overall performance to define a longer leasetime. In a home directory hierarchy like **/eos/user/f/foo** the first three directory level could have a longer lease time defined.

.. code-block:: bash

   [root@eos ]# eos attr set sys.forced.leasetime=86400 /eos/
   [root@eos ]# eos attr set sys.forced.leasetime=86400 /eos/user/
   [root@eos ]# eos attr set sys.forced.leasetime=86400 /eos/user/f
   

File State Tracking for eosxd
-----------------------------


The namespace registers the state changes of a file inside the extended attribute *sys.fusex.state*.

The extended attribute can track up to 127 operations, then gets truncated to half. A truncation is indicated with a leading *|>* in the attribute.

Possible state flags are:

* C      := File has been created by the FuseServer
* U      := File has been updated in the FuseServer
* T      := File has been truncated in the FuseServer or opened with a TRUNCATE flag
* ±      := File size has been changed
* R      := File has been renamed in the FuseServer
* M      := File has been moved in the FuseServer
* 0      := an invalid operation has been seen in the FuseServer (should never happen)
* Z      := File recovery has been triggered by a FUSE client
* +fs    := File replica/stripe has been committed ( multiple entries possible, fs is the filesystem id in decimal)
* c      := File checksum has been committed
* s      := File size has been committed
* v      := Replica has been verified for the checkusm
* V      := Replica has been verified for the size
* |      := Terminates a commit sequence started with +fs
* |>     := tracked operations exceeded 127 and the attribute has been truncated


Example:

.. code-block:: bash

   [root@eos ]# eos attr ls /eos/file
                ...
                sys.fusex.state="CU±+2sc|+1v|U±+2sc|+1v|U±+2sc|+1v|"
                ...

This examples show the creation "C", the file size update "U±", a commit from filesystem 2 with checksum and size "+2sc", a commit from filesystem 1 with checksum verification "+1v", then subsequent two update sequences to the file resulting in filesize change.


Replica/Chunk Tracking 
----------------------

The namespace registers all replica/stripe create,unlink and delete operation inside the extended attribute *sys.fs.tracking*.

The extended attribute truncates when it exceeds 127 letters to half. A truncation is nidicated with a leading *|>* in the attribute.

Possible indicators are:

* +fsid  := a replica/stripe was attached on filesystem fsid
* -fsid  := a replica/stripe has been unlinked for filesystem fsid
* /fsid  := a replica/stripe has been deleted on filesystem fsid

Example:

.. code-block:: bash
  
   [root@eos  ]# eos attr ls /eos/file
                 ...
                 sys.fs.tracking="+1+2+3+4-1-2/1/2"
                 ...

This examples shows the how replicas are attached on filesystems 1,2,3,4, then unlinked on 1,2 and finally deleted on 1,2.

   single: Permission System

Permission System
=================

Overview
--------

The EOS permission system is based on a combination of **ACLs**  and **POSIX** permissions.

There are two major differences to traditional storage systems:

#. Files don't carry their permissions (only the ownership for quota accounting). They inherit the permissions from the parent directory.
#. Permissions are only checked in the direct parent, EOS is not walking through the complete directory hierarchy.
#. For ACLs, a directory ACL applies to all files, except those who have their own ACL.

UNIX Permissions

EOS allows to set user, group and other permissions for read write and browsing defined 
by ``'r'(4), 'w'(2), 'x'(1)``, e.g. ``777 ='rwx'``.

Unlike in POSIX the S_ISGID (2---) indicates that any new directory created should automatically inherit all the 
extended attributes defined at creation time from the parent directory.

If the parent attributes are changed after creation, they are not automatically 
applied to its children. The inheritance bit is always added to any *chmod* automatically. >

All modes for *chmod* have to be given in octal format. For details see **eos chmod --help**.

The S_ISVTX bit (1---) is displayed whenever a directory has any extended attribute defined.

ACLs
----
ACLs are defined on the directory or file level via the extended attributes. 

.. code-block:: bash

   sys.acl=<acllist>
   user.acl=<acllist>

.. note::

   For efficiency, file-level ACLs should only be used sparingly, in favour of directory-level ACLs.

The sys.acl attribute can only be defined by SUDO members. 
The user.acl attribute can be defined by the **owner** or SUDO members. It is only evaluated if the sys.eval.useracl attribute is set.

The sys.acl/user.acl attributes are inherited from the parent at the time a directory is created. Subsequent changes to a directory's ACL
do not automatically apply to child directories. 

<acllist> is defined as a comma separated list of rules:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   <acllist> = <rule1>,<rule2>...<ruleN>

A rule is defined in the following way:

.. code-block:: bash

   <rule> = u:<uid|username>|g:<gid|groupname>|egroup:<name>|z::{rwxomqci(!d)(+d)(!u)(+u)}

A rule has three colon-separated fields. It starts with the type of rule: 
User (u), Group (g), eGroup (egroup) or all (z). The second field specifies the name or 
the unix ID of user/group rules and the eGroup name for eGroups  
The last field contains the rule definition. 

The following tags compose a rule:

.. epigraph::

   === =========================================================================
   tag definition
   === =========================================================================
   r   grant read permission
   w   grant write permissions
   x   grant browsing permission
   m   grant change mode permission
   !m  forbid change mode operations
   !d  forbid deletion of files and directories
   +d  overwrite a '!d' rule and allow deletion of files and directories
   !u  forbid update of files
   +u  overwrite a '!u' rule and allow updates for files 
   q   grant 'set quota' permissions on a quota node
   c   grant 'change owner' permission on directory children
   i   set the immutable flag    
   === =========================================================================




Actually, every single-letter permission with the exception of change owner (c) can
be explicitely denied ('!'), e.g. '!w!r, re-granted ('+'). Change owner
permission is only explicitly enabled on grant, so it is denied by default.
Denials persist after all other rules have been evaluated, i.e. in 'u:fred:!w!r,g:fredsgroup:wrx' the user "fred"
is denied reading and writing although the group he is in has read+write access.
Rights can be re-granted (in sys.acl only) even when denied by specyfing e.g. '+d'. Hence,
when sys.acl='g:admins:+d' and then user.acl='z:!d' are evaluated,
the group "admins" is granted the 'd' right although it is denied to everybody else.

A complex example is shown here:

.. code-block:: bash

   sys.acl="u:300:rw!u,g:z2:rwo,egroup:eos-dev:rwx,u:dummy:rwm!d,u:adm:rwxmqc"

   # user id 300 can read + write, but not update
   #
   # group z2 can read + write-once (create new files but can't delete)
   #
   # members of egroup 'eos-dev' can read & write & browse
   #
   # user name dummy can read + write into directory and modify the permissions 
   # (chmod), but cannot delete directories inside which are not owned by him.
   #
   # user name adm can read,write,browse, change-mod, set quota on that 
   # directory and change the ownership of directory children

.. note::

   Write-once and '!d' or '!u' rules remove permissions which can only be regained 
   by a second rule adding the '+u' or '+d' flag e.g. if the matching user ACL 
   forbids deletion it is not granted if a group rule does not forbid deletion!


It is possible to write rules, which apply to everyone:

.. code-block:: bash

   sys.acl="z:i"
 
   # this directory is immutable for everybody


The user.acl (if defined) is evaluated after the sys.acl, e.g. If we have:

.. code-block:: bash
   
    sys.acl=’g:admins:+d’ and user.acl=’z:!d’
    
i.e., the group “admins” is granted the 'd' right although it is denied to everybody else in the user.acl.


Finally the ACL can be set via either of the following 2 commands, see `eos acl --help` or `eos attr set --help`. From the operational perspective one may prefer the former command as it acts specifically on the element we change (egroup, user ... etc.) instead of re-specifying the whole permission set of rules (`eos attr set` case). `eos acl` set of commands also allow for specific position to place the rule in when creating or modifying a rule. By default rules are appended at the end of the acl, `--front` flag allows to place a rule at the front, and an integer position starting from 1 (which is equivalent to `--front`) can also be used to explicitly move a rule to a specific position via the `--position` argument.

.. code-block:: bash
   
   eos attr set sys.acl=<rule_a>,<rule_b>.. /eos/mypath
   eos acl --sys <rule_c> /eos/mypath
   eos acl --front <rule_d> /eos/mypath
   eos acl --position 2 <rule_f> /eos/mypath

The ACLs can be listed by either of these commands as well:

.. code-block:: bash
    
   eos attr ls /eos/mypath
   eos acl -l /eos/mypath
   

If the operator uses the `eos acl --sys <rule> /eos/mypath` command, the <rule> is composed as follows: 
`[u|g|egroup]:<identifier>[:|=]<permission>`. The second delimiter [:|=] can be a ":" for modifying permissions 
or "=" for setting/overwriting permission. Finally a <permission> itself can be added using the "+" or removed using the "-" operators. 

For example:  

.. code-block:: bash

   $ eos attr ls /eos/mypath
   sys.acl="u:99999:rw,egroup:mygroup:rw"
   #
   # if you try to set the deletion permission using ':' modification sign:
   $ eos acl --sys 'egroup:mygroup:!d' /eos/mypath
   #
   # you will get an error since there is no deletion permission defined yet in the original ACL (i.e. nothing to be modified), but 
   # one can add this new !d permission to the existing ACLs by the '+' operator:
   $ eos acl --sys 'egroup:mygroup:+!d' /eos/mypath
   #
   -->
   #
   $ eos attr ls /eos/mypath
   sys.acl="egroup:mygroup:rw!d,u:99999:rw"
   #
   # one can also remove this permission by the '-' operator:
   $eos acl --sys 'egroup:mygroup:-!d' /eos/mypath
   -->
   #
   $ eos attr ls /eos/mypath
   sys.acl="u:99999:rw,egroup:mygroup:rw"
   #
   # or set completely new permission, overwriting all by '=':
   eos acl --sys 'egroup:mygroup=w' /eos/mypath
   -->
   #
   $ eos attr ls /eos/mypath
   sys.acl="u:99999:rw,egroup:mygroup:w"
   # append a new rule to the end
   $ eos acl --sys u:1002=\!w /eos/mypath
   $ eos attr ls /eos/mypath
   sys.acl="u:99999:rw,egroup:mygroup:rw,u:1002:!w"

   # Move a rule to the front, the full rule needs to be specified
   $ eos acl --front egroup:mygroup=rw /eos/mypath
   $ eos attr ls /eos/mypath
   sys.acl="egroup:mygroup:rw,u:99999:rw,u:1002:!w"

   # Add a new rule at a specific position
   $ eos acl --position 2  egroup:mygroup2=rwx /eos/mypath
   $ eos attr ls /eos/mypath
   sys.acl="egroup:mygroup:rw,egroup:mygroup2:rwx,u:99999:rw,u:1002:!w"


.. note::

   * The "-r 0 0" can be used to map your account with the sudoers role. This has to be assigned to your account on the EOS instance by the service manager, see `eos vid ls`), e.g. `eos -r 0 0 acl --sys 'egroup:mygroup:!d' /eos/mypath`. 
   * If no '--sys' or '--user' is specified, by default the `eos acl` sets '--sys' permissions. 


Validity of Permissions
----------------------------

File Access
+++++++++++
A file ACL (if it exists), or the directory's ACL is evaluated
for access rights.

A user can read a file if the ACL grants 'r' access
to the user's uid/gid pair. If no ACL grants the access, 
[the directory's] UNIX permissions are evaluated for a matching 'r' permission bit.

A user can create a file if the parent directory grants 'w' access via the ACL 
rules to the user's uid/gid pair. A user cannot overwrite a file if the ACL 
grants 'wo' permission. If the ACL does not grant the access, UNIX permissions 
are evaluated for a matching 'w' permission bit.

.. note::

   The root role (uid=0 gid=0) can always read and write any file. 
   The daemon role (uid=2) can always read any file.

File Deletion
+++++++++++++

A file can be deleted if the parent directory grants 'w' access via the ACL 
rules to the user's uid/gid pair. A user cannot delete a file, 
if the ACL grants 'wo' or '!d' permission. 

.. note:: 

   The root role (uid=0 gid=0) can 
   always delete any file. 

File Permission Modification
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

File permissions cannot be changed, they are automatically inherited from the
parent directory.

File Ownership
++++++++++++++

A user can change the ownership of a file if he/she is member of the SUDO group. 
The root, admin user and admin group role can always change the ownership of a 
file. See **eos chown --help**  for details.

Directory Access
++++++++++++++++

A user can create a directory if they have the UNIX 'wx' permission, or the ACL 
rules grant the 'w' or 'wo' permission. The root role can always create any directory.

A user can list a directory if the UNIX permissions grant 'rx' or the ACL 
grants 'x' rights. 

.. note::
   
   The root, admin user and admin group role can always 
   browse directories.

Directory Deletion
++++++++++++++++++

A user can delete a directory if he/she is the owner of the directory. 
A user can delete a directory if he/she is not the owner of that directory 
in case 'UNIX 'w'permission are granted and '!d' is not defined by a matching 
ACL rule. 

.. note::

   The root role can always delete any directory.

.. warning::

   Deletion only works if directories are empty!

Directory Permission Modification
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A user can modify the UNIX permissions if they are the owner of the file 
and/or the parent directory ACL rules grant the 'm' right. 

.. note::

   The root, admin 
   user and admin group role can always modify the UNIX permissions.

Directory ACL Modification
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A user can modify a directory's system ACL, if they are a member of the SUDO group. 
A user can modify a directory's user ACL, if they are the owner of the directory or 
a member of the SUDO group.

Directory Ownership
+++++++++++++++++++

The root, admin user and admin group role can always change the directory 
owner and group. 
A normal user can change the directory owner if the system ACL allows this, or if the user ACL allows it *and* they change the owner to themselves.

.. warning:: 

   Otherwise, only priviledged users can alter the ownership.

Quota Permission
++++++++++++++++

A user can do 'quota set' if he is a sudoer, has the 'q' ACL permission set on 
the quota node or on the proc directory ``/eos/<instance>/proc``.

Richacl Support
+++++++++++++++

On systems where "richacl"s (a more sophisticated ACL model derived from NFS4 ACLs) are supported, e.g. CentOS7,
the translation between EOS ACLs and richacls is by nature incomplete and not always two-ways:

an effort is made for example to derive a file's or directory's :D: (RICHACL_DELETE) right from the parent's 'd' right,
whereas the :d: (RICHACL_DELETE_CHILD) right translates to the directory's own 'd'.
This helps applications like samba; however, setting
:D: (RICHACL_DELETE) on a directory does not affect the directory's parent as permissions for individual
objects cannot be expressed in EOS ACLs;

the EOS 'm' (change mode) right becomes :CAW: (RICHACE_WRITE_ACL|RICHACE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES|RICHACE_WRITE_NAMED_ATTRS);

the EOS 'u' (update) right becomes :p: (RICHACE_APPEND_DATA), although this is not really equivalent. It implies that :w: (RICHACE_WRITE_DATA) only grants writing of new files,
not rewriting parts of existing files.

Richacls are created and retrieved using the {get,set}richacl commands and the relevant richacl library functions
on the fusex-mounted EOS tree. Those utilities act on the user.acl attribute and ignore sys.acl.


How to setup a shared scratch directory
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If a directory is group writable one should add an ACL entry for this group
to forbid the deletion of files and directories to non-owners and allow
deletion to a dedicated account:

E.g. to define a scratch directory for group 'vl' and the deletion
user 'prod' execute:

.. code-block:: bash

   eos attr set sys.acl=g:vl:!d,u:prod:+d /eos/dev/scratchdisk

How to setup a shared group directory
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A directory shared by a <group> with variable members should be setup like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   chmod 550 <groupdir>
   eos attr set sys.acl="egroup:<group>:rw!m"

Sticky Ownership
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ACL tag sys.owner.auth allows to tag clients acting as the owner of a directory. The value normally is composed by the authentication method and the user name or can be a wildcard.
If a wild card is specified, everybody resulting in having write permission can use the sticky ownership and write into a directory on behalf of the owner e.g. the file is owned by the directory
owner and not by the authenticated client and quota is booked on the directory owner.

.. code-block:: bash

   eos attr set sys.owner.auth="krb5:prod"
   eos attr set sys.owner.auth="*"

Permission Masks
++++++++++++++++

A permission mask which is applied on all chmod requests for directories can be defined via:

.. code-block:: bash

   sys.mask=<octal-mask>

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

   eos attr set sys.mask="770"
   eos chmod 777 <dir>
   success: mode of file/directory <dir> is now '770'

When the mask attribute is set the !m flag is automatically disabled even if it is given in the ACL.

ACL CLI
+++++++

To provide atomic add,remove and replacement of permissions one can take advantage of the ``eos acl`` command instead of modifying directly the `sys.acl` attribute:

.. code-block:: bash

   Usage: eos acl [-l|--list] [-R|--recursive][--sys|--user] <rule> <path>

       --help           Print help
   -R, --recursive      Apply on directories recursively
   -l, --lists          List ACL rules
       --user           Set user.acl rules on directory
       --sys            Set sys.acl rules on directory
   <rule> is created based on chmod rules. 
   Every rule begins with [u|g|egroup] followed with : and identifier.

   Afterwards can be:
   = for setting new permission .
   : for modification of existing permission.
  
   This is followed by the rule definition.
   Every ACL flag can be added with + or removed with -, or in case
   of setting new ACL permission just enter the ACL flag.


Anonymous Access
++++++++++++++++

Anonymous access can be allowed by configuring unix authentication (which maps by default everyone to user nobody). If you want to restrict anonymous access to a certain domain you can configure this via the ``access`` interface:

.. code-block:: bash

   eos access allow domain nobody@cern.ch

As an additional measure you can limit the deepness of the directory tree where anonymous access is possible using the ``vid`` interface e.g. not more than 4 levels:

.. code-block:: bash

   eos vid publicaccesslevel 4


The default value for the publicaccesslevel is 1024.
